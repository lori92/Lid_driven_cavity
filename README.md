# Lid_driven_cavity
Lid driven cavity project in C++

Finite volume code written in C++ to solve the incompressible flow inside a lid driven cavity.
Staggered grid is used, 2nd order discretization in space and time is adopted.
Time advancement is performed using a Crank-Nicholson scheme, integrated within the Chorin-Temam projection method
